This is a mod to fix or create crafting recipes that I've found annoying playing minecraft, so I figured the public could enjoy it too<br/>


* Smithing templates to upgrade leather to chainmail -> chainmail to iron -> iron to diamond
* Smithing tmeplates to upgrade wood to stone -> stone to iron -> iron to diamond
* Rotten flesh is smeltable and smokeable to make leather
* You can remake string from wool
* Chainmail is now craftable with iron nuggets
* Leads are now craftable with string and a slimeball
* Name Tags are now craftable with string, paper, and an ink sac
* Diamond weapons / armor are now smeltable to make diamond nuggets
* Diamond nuggets can be crafted into a diamond and are used for a smithing template
