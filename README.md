Below will show the basic steps and progression for the mod


however Heretical Magic will not be included here as it is supposed to
remain a secret for the most part.


## Pagan Magic


The seeds needed for Pagan Magic are a little rare but not impossible at 0.1% 
they can be collected from basic grass just like other seeds and can then be planted
and farmed for Sidhe Ash which is needed to craft most pagan items and the first sapling; Combine any sapling and one Sidhe Ash for the very first tier of sapling, the tiers in the mod as of now are:

### Tier One: Féth Fíada

### Tier Two: Fianna

A legendary band of warrior-hunters in Irish mythology, led by Fionn mac Cumhaill. The term means "warrior band" or "hunter-warriors." They were skilled in combat, poetry, and survival, and their tales are central to the Fenian Cycle. This is the same tier as iron
